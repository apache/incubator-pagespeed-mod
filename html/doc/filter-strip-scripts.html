<h1>Strip Scripts</h1>    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
      The 'Strip Scripts' filter is enabled by specifying:
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >ModPagespeedEnableFilters strip_scripts</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
     >pagespeed EnableFilters strip_scripts;</pre>
</dl>
    <p>
      in the configuration file.
    </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>strip_scripts</code> filter completely removes scripts from a
      page.  Obviously this will break functionality, and is disabled by
      default.  This can be used to facilitate timing tests showing the
      maximum possible benefit of improving a site's JavaScript performance.
    </p>
    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>
      All functionality and visual effects that are dependent on JavaScript
      will not work.
    </p>
