<h1>mod_pagespeed Security Advisory: Insufficient Hostname Verification</h1>
<dl>
  <dt>CVE Identifier:</dt>
    <dd>CVE-2012-4001</dd>
  <dt>Disclosed:</dt>
    <dd>September 12, 2012</dd>
  <dt>Versions Affected:</dt>
    <dd>All versions of mod_pagespeed up to and including 0.10.22.4.</dd>
  <dt>Summary:</dt>
    <dd>mod_pagespeed performs insufficient verification of its own host name,
    which makes it possible to trick it into doing HTTP fetches and resource
    processing from arbitrary host names, including potentially bypassing
    firewalls.</dd>
  <dt>Solution:</dt>
    <dd>mod_pagespeed 0.10.22.6 has been released with a fix.</dd>
  <dt>Workaround:</dt>
    <dd>If you are unable to upgrade to the new version, you can avoid this
    issue by changing your Apache httpd configuration. Give any virtual host
    that enables mod_pagespeed (and the global configuration, if it also enables
    mod_pagespeed) an accurate explicit <code>ServerName</code>, and set the
    options <code>UseCanonicalName</code> and
    <code>UseCanonicalPhysicalPort</code> to <code>On</code> in each. Please be
    aware, however, that depending on the version,
    <a href="CVE-2012-4360">CVE-2012-4360</a> may also apply.
