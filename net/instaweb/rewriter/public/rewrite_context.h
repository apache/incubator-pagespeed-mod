// RewriteContext manages asynchronous rewriting of some n >= 1 resources (think
// CSS, JS, or images) into m >= 0 improved versions (typically, n = m = 1).
// It also helps update the references in the containing document (called
// slots), such as <img src=> in HTML, or background-image: url() in CSS,
// and make any other changes to it needed to commit the optimization.
//
// It is normally used as a base class, with its own code helping take care
// of caching, fetching, etc., while subclasses describe how to transform the
// resources, and how to update the document containing them with the new
// version by overriding some virtuals like Rewrite() and Render().
//
// Filters parsing HTML create their RewriteContext subclasses for every
// group of resources they think should be optimized together (such as one
// RewriteContext for every image for image re-compression, or one for a group
// of CSS files that have compatible HTML markup for CSS combining). The
// framework may also ask a filter to make its RewriteContext subclass via
// MakeRewriteContext() in case it need to reconstruct an optimized resource
// that's not available in the cache.
//
// In the case of combining filters, a single RewriteContext may
// result in multiple rewritten resources that are partitioned based
// on data semantics.  Most filters will just work on one resource,
// and those can inherit from SingleRewriteContext which is simpler
// to implement.
//
// The most basic transformation steps subclasses will want to implement are:
//
// Partition:
//   Determines how many outputs, if any, will be created from all the inputs.
//   For example, a spriter may create separate partitions for groups of images
//   with similar colormaps. This step is also responsible for deciding what to
//   do if some inputs were not loaded successfully. SingleRewriteContext
//   provides the correct implementation for transformations that take in one
//   file and optimize it.
//
// Rewrite:
//   Takes inputs from one partition, and tries to produce an optimized output
//   for it, as well as a CachedResult, which caches any auxiliary information
//   that may be needed to update the container document. For example, the image
//   filter will store image dimensions inside the CachedResult object.
//
//   If a better version can be created, the subclass should call
//   RewriteDriver::Write with its data, and then RewriteDone(kRewriteOk).
//
//   If no improvement is possible, it should call RewriteDone(kRewriteFailed).
//   Note that this does not mean that nothing can be done, just that no new
//   resource has been created (for example an image filter might still insert
//   dimensions into the <img> tag even if it can't compress the image better).
//
// Render:
//   Updates the document based on information stored in CachedResult.
//   This is the only step that can touch the HTML DOM. Note that you
//   do not need to implement it if you just want to update the URL to the new
//   version: the ResourceSlot's will do it automatically.
//
// Which of the steps get invoked depends on how much information has been
// cached, as well as on timing of things (since the system tries not to
// hold up the web page noticeably to wait for an optimization). Common
// scenarios are:
//
// 1) New rewrite, finishes quickly:
//    Partition -> Rewrite -> Render
// 2) New rewrite, but too slow to render:
//    Partition -> Rewrite
// 3) Metadata cache hit:
//    Render
// 4) Reconstructing output from a .pagespeed. URL:
//    Rewrite
//
// Note in particular that (3) means that all rendering should be doable just
// from information inside the CachedResult.
//
// Top-level RewriteContexts are initialized from the HTML thread, by filters
// responding to parser events.  In particular, from this thread they can be
// constructed, and AddSlot() and Initiate() can be called.  Once Initiate is
// called, the RewriteContext runs purely in its two threads, until
// it completes.  At that time it will self-delete in coordination with
// RewriteDriver.
//
// RewriteContexts can also be nested, in which case they are constructed,
// slotted, and Initated all within the rewrite threads.  However, they
// are Propagated and destructed by their parent, which was initiated by the
// RewriteDriver.
//
// RewriteContext utilizes two threads (via QueuedWorkerPool::Sequence)
// to do most of its work. The "high priority" thread is used to run the
// dataflow graph: queue up fetches and cache requests, partition inputs,
// render results, etc. The actual Rewrite() methods, however, are invoked
// in the "low priority" thread and can be canceled during extreme load
// or shutdown.
