<h2 id="standard">Standard Configuration</h2>
   <p class="warning"><strong>Note: This feature is currently experimental.
     Options and configuration described here are subject to change in future
     releases. Please subscribe to the <a href="mailing-lists#announcements"
     >announcements mailing list</a> to keep yourself informed of updates to
     this feature.</strong></p>

   <p>
     By default PageSpeed serves HTML files with <code>Cache-Control: no-cache,
     max-age=0</code> so that changes to the HTML and its resources are sent
     fresh on each request.  The HTML can be cached, however, if you:
     <ul>
       <li> Set up a <code>PURGE</code> handler in your cache.
       <li> Tell PageSpeed the url for the <code>PURGE</code> handler.
       <li> Have the cache set the <code>PS-CapabilityList</code> header
            so PageSpeed will emit HTML that can be sent to any browser.
       <li> Have the cache occasionally pass through requests to the origin with
            the <code>PS-ShouldBeacon</code> header set.
     </ul>
   </p>

   <p>
     For example, if you're running a cache on port 80 that reverse proxies to
     your site on port 8080, then you'd need to tell PageSpeed to send
     its <code>PURGE</code> requests to port 80:
   </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedDownstreamCachePurgeLocationPrefix http://localhost:80</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed DownstreamCachePurgeLocationPrefix http://localhost:80;</pre>
</dl>
   <p>
     You also need to give PageSpeed a key so it can allow the cache to request
     rebeaconing without allowing external entities to do so:
   </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedDownstreamCacheRebeaconingKey "&lt;your-secret-key&gt;"</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed DownstreamCacheRebeaconingKey "&lt;your-secret-key&gt;";</pre>
</dl>
   <p>
     These are the only changes you need to make to the PageSpeed configuration
     file, but before you restart you also need to make some changes to your
     cache configuration.  These vary by cache; below are configurations for
     Varnish 3.x, Varnish 4.x, and Nginx's proxy_cache:
   </p>

</dl>

<p>
  When running with downstream caching all resources referenced from the HTML
  will be cache-extended as usual, so if you have resources that need to be
  cached for a short time then they can be stale.  If so,
  either <code>Disallow</code> those resources, so PageSpeed doesn't inline or
  cache-extend them, or decrease the cache lifetime on your HTML.
</p>

<h2 id="additional">Additional Options</h2>

The configuration above should be a good fit for most sites, but PageSpeed's
downstream caching is highly configurable with many options that allow you to
tweak it for your particular setup.

<h3 id="beaconing">Beaconing</h3>
<p>
  Several filters such as
  <a href="reference-image-optimize#inline_images">inline_images</a>,
  <a href="filter-inline-preview-images">inline_preview_images</a>,
  <a href="filter-lazyload-images">lazyload_images</a> and
  <a href="filter-prioritize-critical-css">prioritize_critical_css</a>
  depend extensively on client beacons to determine critical images and
  CSS. When such filters are enabled, pages periodically have beaconing
  JavaScript inserted as part of the rewriting process.
  The <a href="#standard">standard configuration</a> passes through 5% of cache
  hits to the backend with a <code>PS-ShouldBeacon</code> header set, so that
  these filters can continue to receive the beacons they need.
</p>
<p>
  If you have a high traffic site, 5% is probably a larger share than you need
  for PageSpeed to receive sufficient beacons.  In that case you can decrease
  the percentage of traffic to pass through.  For example, here's how you'd
  decrease it to 2%:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Varnish 3.x or 4.x:<dd><pre>
<span class=diff-del>-  if (std.random(0, 100) < 5) {</span>
<span class=diff-add>+  if (std.random(0, 100) < 2) {</span></pre>
  <dt>Nginx proxy_cache<dd><pre>
<span class=diff-del>-  if ($rand ~* "^[0-4]$") {</span>
<span class=diff-add>+  if ($rand ~* "^[01]$") {</span></pre>
</dl>
<p>
  Alternatively, you may be willing to give up the benefit of the
  beaconing-dependent filters in exchange for never intentionally bypassing the
  cache.  If so, you should <a href="config_filters#beacons">turn off
  beaconing</a> and beacon-dependent filters in PageSpeed:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
>ModPagespeedCriticalImagesBeaconEnabled false
ModPagespeedDisableFilters prioritize_critical_css</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint"
>pagespeed CriticalImagesBeaconEnabled false;
pagespeed DisableFilters prioritize_critical_css;</pre>
</dl>
<p>
  Additionally you should remove the proxy config that handles beaconing:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Varnish 3.x:<dd><pre><span class="diff-del"
>-  remove req.http.PS-ShouldBeacon;
...
-  if (std.random(0, 100) < 5) {
-    set req.http.PS-ShouldBeacon = "&lt;your-secret-key&gt;";
-    return (pass);
-  }
...
-  if (std.random(0, 100) < 25) {
-    set req.http.PS-ShouldBeacon = "&lt;your-secret-key&gt;";
-    return (pass);
-  }</span></pre>
  <dt>Varnish 4.x:<dd><pre><span class="diff-del"
>-  unset req.http.PS-ShouldBeacon;
...
-  sub vcl_hit {
-    if (std.random(0, 100) < 5) {
-      set req.http.PS-ShouldBeacon = "&lt;your-secret-key&gt;";
-      return (pass);
-    }
-  }
-  sub vcl_miss {
-    if (std.random(0, 100) < 25) {
-      set req.http.PS-ShouldBeacon = "&lt;your-secret-key&gt;";
-      return (pass);
-    }
-  }</span></pre>
  <dt>Nginx proxy_cache<dd><pre><span class="diff-del"
>-  set $should_beacon_header_val "";
-  set_random $rand 0 100;
-  if ($rand ~* "^[0-4]$") {
-    set $should_beacon_header_val "&lt;your-secret-key&gt;";
-    set $bypass_cache 1;
-  }
...
-  proxy_cache_bypass $bypass_cache;
-  proxy_hide_header PS-ShouldBeacon;
-  proxy_set_header PS-ShouldBeacon $should_beacon_header_val;</span></pre>
</dl>


<h3 id="ps-resource">PageSpeed Resources</h3>
<p>
  Because PageSpeed already caches its optimized resources, you may want to
  exclude them caching by the downstream cache.  If so, you can set:

<dl>
  <dt>Varnish 3.x and 4.x:<dd><pre><span class="diff-add"
>+  if (req.url ~ "\.pagespeed\.([a-z]\.)?[a-z]{2}\.[^.]{10}\.[^.]+") {
+    return (pass);
+  }</span></pre>
  <dt>Nginx proxy_cache<dd><pre><span class="diff-add"
>+  if ($uri ~ "\.pagespeed\.([a-z]\.)?[a-z]{2}\.[^.]{10}\.[^.]+") {
+    set $bypass_cache "1";
+  }</span></pre>
</dl>

<p>
  If you have enabled <a href="restricting_urls#url_signatures">URL signing</a>,
  change the <code>10</code> in the regexp to <code>20</code> to account for the
  additional characters in the hash.
</p>

<h3 id="ps-capabilitylist">PS-CapabilityList</h3>

<p>
  Typically PageSpeed will produce different HTML for different browsers.  For
  example, when responding to a request that has <code>Accept:
  image/webp</code>, PageSpeed knows the requesting browser supports WebP and so
  it can send these images, while if the <code>Accept</code> header doesn't
  mention WebP then it will send JPEG or PNG.  To suppress this behavior,
  the <a href="#standard">standard configuration</a> above sets a header:
</p>
<pre>
  PS-CapabilityList: fully general optimizations only
</pre>
<p>
  This header can also be used to tell PageSpeed to make specific optimizations.
  There are five capabilities PageSpeed can take advantage of that aren't
  supported in all browsers, and it gives them each a code:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Capability<th>Code
  <tr><td>Inline Images<td><code>ii</code>
  <tr><td>Lazyload Images<td><code>ll</code>
  <tr><td>WebP Images<td><code>jw</code>
  <tr><td>Lossless WebP Images<td><code>ws</code>
  <tr><td>Animated WebP Images<td><code>wa</code>
  <tr><td>Defer Javascript<td><code>dj</code>
</table>
<p>
  For example, you could include whether the <code>Accept</code> header
  includes <code>image/webp</code> in your cache key, and then for the
  fraction of traffic that claimed webp support send:
</p>
<pre>
  PS-CapabilityList: jw:
</pre>
<p>
  Every page would go through to your origin twice and be cached twice, once
  processed with WebP support and once without.
</p>
<p>
  You can combine multiple capabilities together with a comma.  For example, if
  you decided to make a cache fragment for Chrome 30+, which supports all of
  these, for that fragment you would send:
</p>
<pre>
  PS-CapabilityList: ll,ii,dj,jw,ws:
</pre>
<p>
  For Firefox 4+, which supports all of these but WebP, you would send:
</p>
<pre>
  PS-CapabilityList: ll,ii,dj:
</pre>
<p>
  To use this header properly, however, you have to know which capabilities are
  supported by which browsers in the version of PageSpeed you're using and craft
  regular expressions to match exactly those ones.  This is very difficult to do
  in general because it involves duplicating the code in
  <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-pagespeed-mod/blob/latest-stable/pagespeed/kernel/http/user_agent_matcher.cc"><code>user_agent_matcher.cc</code></a>
  as regexes, but a simple division is:
  <ul>
    <li>Chrome 32+: <code>ll,ii,dj,jw,wa,ws</code>
    <li>Firefox 4+, Safari, IE10 (but not IE11): <code>ll,ii,dj</code>
    <li>Everything else: <code>fully general optimizations only</code>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3 id="purge-get">Purging with GET</h3>

<p>
  If you're integrating PageSpeed with a cache that doesn't
  support <code>PURGE</code> requests but does support purging in response to a
  prefixed <code>GET</code> request, PageSpeed can support that.  You would
  configure your cache to treat a <code>GET</code> to
  <code>/purge/foo/bar</code> as a request to purge <code>/foo/bar</code> and
  configure PageSpeed as:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedDownstreamCachePurgeLocationPrefix http://CACHE-HOST:PORT/purge
ModPagespeedDownstreamCachePurgeMethod GET</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed DownstreamCachePurgeLocationPrefix http://CACHE-HOST:PORT/purge;
pagespeed DownstreamCachePurgeMethod GET;</pre>
</dl>

<h3 id="purge-threshold">Purge Threshold</h3>
<p>
  Whenever PageSpeed serves an HTML response that is not fully optimized it
  continues rewriting in the background.  When it finishes, if the HTML it
  served was less than 95% optimized, it sends a purge request to the downstream
  cache.  The next request to come in will bypass the cache and come back to
  PageSpeed where it can serve out the now more highly optimized page.  If you
  want to change what point PageSpeed considers the page done and stops
  optimizing, you can set a different value for this threshold.  For example, to
  lower it to 80%, so that PageSpeed is satisfied with a page that is only 80%
  optimized, you would set:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Apache:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
ModPagespeedDownstreamCacheRewrittenPercentageThreshold 80</pre>
  <dt>Nginx:<dd><pre class="prettyprint">
pagespeed DownstreamCacheRewrittenPercentageThreshold 80;</pre>
</dl>

<h3 id="script-variables">Script Variables</h3>
<p class="note"><strong>Note: Nginx-only</strong></p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note: New feature as of 1.10.33.0</strong></p>

<p>
  In ngx_pagespeed <code>DownstreamCachePurgeLocationPrefix</code>,
  <code>DownstreamCachePurgeMethod</code>, and
  <code>DownstreamCacheRewrittenPercentageThreshold</code> support script
  variables, so it's possible to set them on a per-request basis.  Turn this on
  with:
<pre class="prettyprint">
http {
  pagespeed ProcessScriptVariables on;
  ...
}</pre>
  You can then use script variables in arguments for these commands:
<pre class="prettyprint">
  pagespeed DownstreamCachePurgeLocationPrefix "$purge_location";
  pagespeed DownstreamCachePurgeMethod "$cache_purge_method";
  pagespeed DownstreamCacheRewrittenPercentageThreshold "$rewrite_threshold";</pre>
</p>
<p>
  For more details on script variables, including how to handle dollar signs,
  see <a href="system#nginx_script_variables">Script Variable Support</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation Details</h2>
<p>
  To support downstream caching PageSpeed sends a purge request to the caching
  layer whenever it identifies an opportunity for more rewriting to be done on
  content that was just served. Such opportunities could arise because of, say,
  the resources now becoming available in the PageSpeed cache or an image
  compression operation completing. The cache purge forces the next request for
  the HTML file to come all the way to the backend PageSpeed server and obtain
  better rewritten content, which is then stored in the cache. This interaction
  between the PageSpeed server and the downstream caching layer is depicted in
  the diagram given below.
</p>
  <img src="images/downstream_caching.png" >
<p>
  In the interaction depicted above, note that the partially optimized HTML will
  be served from the cache until a purge request gets sent by the PageSpeed
  server.  It is recommended to set up PageSpeed and the downstream caching
  layer servers on a one to one basis so that the purges can be sent to the
  correct downstream server.
