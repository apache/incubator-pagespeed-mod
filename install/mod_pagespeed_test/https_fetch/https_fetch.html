    Note that we won't be able to image-optimize
    https://www.gstatic.com/psa/static/1.gif, and we have disabled
    inlining in this directory, so we won't inline it.  But we will cache-extend
    it because the cache-extender will work on long-ttl files if it also forces
    a domain change.  Succeeding doing this proves we can fetch it, which we
    need to do in order to compute a hash.
