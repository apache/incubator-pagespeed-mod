// A brief refresher on GLib:
//     GLib sources have four callbacks: Prepare, Check, Dispatch and Finalize.
// On each iteration of the GLib pump, it calls each source's Prepare function.
// This function should return TRUE if it wants GLib to call its Dispatch, and
// FALSE otherwise.  It can also set a timeout in this case for the next time
// Prepare should be called again (it may be called sooner).
//     After the Prepare calls, GLib does a poll to check for events from the
// system.  File descriptors can be attached to the sources.  The poll may block
// if none of the Prepare calls returned TRUE.  It will block indefinitely, or
// by the minimum time returned by a source in Prepare.
//     After the poll, GLib calls Check for each source that returned FALSE
// from Prepare.  The return value of Check has the same meaning as for Prepare,
// making Check a second chance to tell GLib we are ready for Dispatch.
//     Finally, GLib calls Dispatch for each source that is ready.  If Dispatch
// returns FALSE, GLib will destroy the source.  Dispatch calls may be recursive
// (i.e., you can call Run from them), but Prepare and Check cannot.
//     Finalize is called when the source is destroyed.
// NOTE: It is common for subsystems to want to process pending events while
// doing intensive work, for example the flash plugin. They usually use the
// following pattern (recommended by the GTK docs):
// while (gtk_events_pending()) {
//   gtk_main_iteration();
// }
//
// gtk_events_pending just calls g_main_context_pending, which does the
// following:
// - Call prepare on all the sources.
// - Do the poll with a timeout of 0 (not blocking).
// - Call check on all the sources.
// - *Does not* call dispatch on the sources.
// - Return true if any of prepare() or check() returned true.
//
// gtk_main_iteration just calls g_main_context_iteration, which does the whole
// thing, respecting the timeout for the poll (and block, although it is to if
// gtk_events_pending returned true), and call dispatch.
//
// Thus it is important to only return true from prepare or check if we
// actually have events or work to do. We also need to make sure we keep
// internal state consistent so that if prepare/check return true when called
// from gtk_events_pending, they will still return true when called right
// after, from gtk_main_iteration.
//
// For the GLib pump we try to follow the Windows UI pump model:
// - Whenever we receive a wakeup event or the timer for delayed work expires,
// we run DoSomeWork. That part will also run in the other event pumps.
// - We also run DoSomeWork, and possibly DoIdleWork, in the main loop,
// around event handling.
