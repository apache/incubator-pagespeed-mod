  # cause our build to be killed. travis_wait allows the command to be silent
  # for longer, but has the downside of not producing output if we timeout. See:
  # https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received
  # For now, stick with --verbose and keep an eye on the logs.
