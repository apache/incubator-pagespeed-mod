    <p>This page includes two images as CSS backgrounds.  PageSpeed will
    create a single sprite to minimize roundtrips.</p>
    First image:
    <div id="bg_Cuppa"></div>
    Second image:
    <div id="bg_BikeCrashIcn"></div>
    This image won't be sprited because we only handle PNGs right now:
    <div id="bg_Puzzle"></div>
    This is the third image, a .gif.
    <div id="bg_IronChef"></div>
