<h1>mod_pagespeed 0.10.22.6 Security Update.</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
mod_pagespeed 0.10.22.6 is a security update that fixes two critical issues
that affect earlier versions:
<ul>
<li><a href="CVE-2012-4001">CVE-2012-4001</a>, a problem with validation of
own host name.
</li>
<li><a href="CVE-2012-4360">CVE-2012-4360</a>, a cross-site scripting
  attack, which affects versions starting from 0.10.19.1.
</li>
</ul>

<p> The effect of the first problem is that it is possible to confuse
mod_pagespeed about its own host name, and to trick it into fetching resources
from other machines. This could be an issue if the HTTP server has access to
machines that are not otherwise publicly visible.

<p> The second problem would permit a hostile third party to execute JavaScript
in users' browsers in context of the domain running mod_pagespeed, which
could permit interception of users' cookies or data on the site.

<p> Because of the severity of the two problems, users are <strong>strongly
</strong> encouraged to update immediately.
</p>

<h2 id="behavior_changes">Behavior Changes in the Update</h2>
As part of the fix to the first issue, mod_pagespeed will not fetch
resources from machines other than <code>localhost</code> if they are not
explicitly mentioned in the configuration. This means that if you need
resources on the server's domain to be handled by some other system, you'll
need to explicitly use <code>ModPagespeedMapOriginDomain</code> or
<code>ModPagespeedDomain</code> to authorize that.
