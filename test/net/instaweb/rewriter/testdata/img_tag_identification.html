  <!-- Bits cribbed from old bbc.co.uk front page, which shows various forms
       of img tag in various contexts.  Note different tag terminations,
       orders for stuff like alt, mixtures of included and excluded
       geometries, etc.  Note also varying shapes of o.gif in different links,
       and the fact that this image sometimes has a CGI suffix!

       Also note the occurrences of images in <noscript> regions, which
       presumably won't be fetched and shouldn't be optimized (in these cases
       they're marker gifs, but in general they could be anything; do other
       cases happen much?).  Note also the inconsistent handling of marker
       images: width="0" height="0" style="display:none" versus width="1"
       height="1".

       By the way, do we get bw/latency savings if we drop the quotes ""
       around image geometries?  For pages like bbc.co.uk with tons of
       whitespace images that could put us under a packet threshold.  But if
       it doesn't make the gzip smaller it's not worth the bother.
