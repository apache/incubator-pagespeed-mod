mod_pagespeed is an open-source Apache module which automatically applies web performance best practices to pages, and associated assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) without requiring that you modify your existing content or workflow.

- Image optimization, compression, and resizing
- CSS & JavaScript concatenation, minification, and inlining
- Cache extension, domain sharding, and domain rewriting
- Deferred loading of JavaScript and image resources
- and many others...
