    <p style="max-width:35em;">

    PageSpeed will rewrite links to PDFs to include a content-hash.  PDFs
    are identified by having extension ".pdf".  Note that this requires a
    background asynchronous fetch of the PDF; therefore the page may not be
    rewritten the first time.  If it isn't, wait a few seconds and reload.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Standard link to a pdf, will be cache extended:
         <a href="example.pdf">example.pdf</a></li>
      <li>Embedded pdf, will also be cache extended:
        <br>
        <dd><embed src="example.pdf" width="150" height="100"></li>
      <li>Link to a PDF with extension ".notpdf".  It won't be cache extended
          because a ".pdf" extension is required:
          <a href="example.notpdf">example.notpdf</a></li>
      <li>Link to a PDF with a query parameter, will be cache extended:
         <a href="example.pdf?a=b">example.pdf?a=b</a></li>
