    <p>An 1023x766 image displayed in a 256x192 thumbnail. PageSpeed
      will resize it and also serve with a srcset for other sizes.</p>
    <img src="images/Puzzle.jpg" width="256" height="192"/><br/>

    <p>An 1023x766 image displayed at full size. PageSpeed may recompress it,
      but will not add a srcset.</p>
    <img src="images/Puzzle.jpg" width="1023" height="766"/><br/>

    <p>An 1023x766 image displayed at 682x511 (2/3 scale). PageSpeed will
      resize it and also serve a 1.5x version in srcset (but not 2x since
      that would be redundant).</p>
    <img src="images/Puzzle.jpg" width="682" height="511"/><br/>

    <p>A small image. PageSpeed will inline it and not set a srcset.</p>
    <img src="images/Cuppa.png" width="10" height="10"/><br/>

    <p>A medium size image with no listed width nor height. PageSpeed
      will losslessly re-encode it, but not resize it nor add a srcset
      for other sizes.</p>
    <img src="images/BikeCrashIcn.png"/><br/>

    <p>An image with data-pagespeed-no-transform. PageSpeed will not
      transform this file.</p>
