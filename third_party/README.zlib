We currently pull zlib from a pagespeed git mirror, however there's a there's
a perfectly fine zlib repo at https://github.com/madler/zlib.git.
We should copy the gyp file out of the zlib repo and into the mod_pagespeed
one, after which we can switch to the official zlib repo and delete
https://github.com/pagespeed/zlib.
