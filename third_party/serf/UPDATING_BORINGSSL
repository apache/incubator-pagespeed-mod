Updating BoringSSL can sometimes be tricky!

Because sometimes the gypi file can change drastically upstream, we will
have to take the gypi file from chromium's stable and modify the paths.
The latest stable version of chromium can be found here.
http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/search/label/Stable%20updates

Export the version number as $CHROMIUM_VERSION

  To update BoringSSL to latest chromium-stable proper, and include the update
  in a pending commit:
    cd third_party/boringssl/src
    git checkout chromium-stable
    cd ..
    git add src
    cd ../../

  Then:
  SERF_DIR=$PWD/third_party/serf

  Move to a fresh/temporary working directory.

  git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
  cd src
  git checkout $CHROMIUM_VERSION
  cd ..

  # Now copy the build files
  cat src/third_party/boringssl/boringssl.gypi \
    | sed 's~src/~<(openssl_root)/~g' \
    > $SERF_DIR/openssl.gypi
  # You probably don't need to change the .gyp file, but that's a place to look
  # if you get build errors.

  # copy the assembly routines and err_data
  cp src/third_party/boringssl/err_data.c $SERF_DIR/
  for arch in linux-x86 linux-x86_64 mac-x86_64 mac-x86 win-x86 \
              win-x86_64 linux-aarch64 linux-arm ; do
    rm -rf $SERF_DIR/$arch/
    cp -r src/third_party/boringssl/$arch $SERF_DIR/$arch/
  done
