/**
 * ObservableSupplier wraps an asynchronously provided object E, notifying observers when the
 * dependency is available. This allows classes dependent on E to be provided with a
 * ObservableSupplier during construction and register a Callback<E> to be notified when the needed
 * dependency is available.
 *
 * This class must only be accessed from a single thread.
 *
 * For classes owning the ObservableSupplier and providing it as a dependency to others, see
 * {@link ObservableSupplierImpl}.
 *
 * For classes using a ObservableSupplier to receive a dependency:
 *   - To be notified when the object is available, call {@link #addObserver(Callback)} with a
 *     Callback to be notified when the object is available.
 *   - If the object is already available, the Callback will be called immediately.
 *   - The Callback may be called multiple times if the object wrapped by the ObservableSupplier
 *     changes.
 *
 * @param <E> The type of the wrapped object.
