      <p>
      The prioritize_critical_css filter identifies selectors from css
      references and introduces them into the beaconing javascript code. If the
      InlineUnauthorizedResources option is enabled, selectors from unauthorized
      resources such as the www.google.com default.css resource will also be
      considered, but unauthorized @import references will not be considered.
