<h1>January 2016 PageSpeed Security Update.</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>All released versions of PageSpeed are subject to HTTPS-fetching
vulnerability, CVE-2016-2092.  This permits a hostile third party who can
man-in-the-middle the connection between PageSpeed and an HTTPS server to
substitute arbitrary content in responses.  This could allow the attacker to
execute JavaScript in users' browsers in context of the domain running
PageSpeed, which could permit theft of users' cookies or data on the site.
</p>

<p>To be notified of further security updates subscribe to the
<a href="mailing-lists#announcements">announcements mailing list</a>.

<h2 id="affected-versions">Affected versions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All versions earlier than 1.9.</li>
  <li>Versions 1.9.32.0 &ndash; 1.9.33.12 (fixed in 1.9.32.13).</li>
  <li>Versions 1.10.33.0 &ndash; 1.10.33.3 (fixed in 1.10.33.4).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="affected-configurations">Affected configurations</h2>

<p>Sites using the default configuration are not vulnerable, because by default
PageSpeed will only use HTTPS to fetch from itself.  To be vulnerable a site
needs to have configured either:

<ul>
  <li>Any of the following directives with an HTTPS target on another server:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="domains#auth_domains"><code>Domain</code></a></li>
    <li><a href="domains#mapping_origin"><code>MapOriginDomain</code></a></li>
    <li><a href="domains#MapProxyDomain"><code>MapProxyDomain</code></a></li>
    <li><code>FetchProxy</code></a> (experimental and undocumented)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Or any of the following directives:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="domains#fetch_servers"
      ><code>DangerPermitFetchFromUnknownHosts</code></a></li>
    <li><a href="domains#inline_without_auth"
      ><code>InlineResourcesWithoutExplicitAuthorization</code></a></li>
    <li><a href="filter-css-inline-google-fonts"
      ><code>EnableFilters inline_google_font_css</code></a></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>
You can resolve this problem by updating to the latest version of either stable
or beta channels.
</p>

<h3 id="latest">Upgrading to the latest version</h3>

<p>
The easiest way to resolve the vulnerability is to update to the latest
versions on whatever channel (stable or beta) are you currently using.
</p>

<p>If you installed the .rpm package, you can update with:
<pre>
sudo yum update
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart
</pre>

<p>If you installed the .deb package, you can update with:
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</pre>

It is also possible to <a href="build_mod_pagespeed_from_source">
build from source. </a>

<h2 id="sig">Package signing information</h2>
All of the packages above are signed with the Google Linux Package Signing Key,
as described on <a href="http://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/">
http://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/</a>

<h2 id="workaround">Workaround</h2>

If you are unable to upgrade to the new version, you can work around this
vulnerability by either explicitly disabling fetching of resources over HTTPS or
by removing the <a href="affected-configurations">configuration directives</a>
that enable fetching over HTTPS from other hosts.
